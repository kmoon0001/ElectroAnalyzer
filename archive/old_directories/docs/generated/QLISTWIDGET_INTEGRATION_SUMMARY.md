- **Confidence Scoring**: AI confidence indicators (üéØ High, ‚ö†Ô∏è Medium, ‚ùì Low)
- **Interactive Selection**: Click to select findings with signal emission
- **Context Menu Actions**:
  - üìã View Details - Detailed finding information dialog
  - üîç Highlight in Document - Navigate to source text
  - üí¨ Discuss with AI - Open contextual chat
  - ‚ö†Ô∏è Dispute Finding - Mark findings as disputed
  - ‚úÖ Mark as Reviewed - Track review status
- **Filtering**: Filter by risk level (All, High, Medium, Low)
- **Visual States**: Different styling for disputed and reviewed findings

**Integration Points**:
- Connected to main window via signals (`finding_selected`, `finding_disputed`)
- Integrated with document highlighting system
- Connected to AI chat system for contextual assistance

### 2. DocumentHistoryListWidget
**Location**: Integrated into the Dashboard tab

**Features**:
- **Document Type Icons**: Visual indicators for different document types (üìù Progress Note, üìã Evaluation, etc.)
- **Compliance Score Display**: Color-coded scores with percentage indicators
- **Chronological Ordering**: Most recent documents appear first
- **Context Menu Actions**:
  - üìä View Analysis Report - Detailed analysis summary
  - üîÑ Re-analyze Document - Trigger reanalysis
  - üì§ Export Report - Export analysis results
  - üóëÔ∏è Delete from History - Remove from history
- **Dual Filtering System**:
  - Minimum compliance score filter (0-100%)
  - Document type filter (All, Progress Note, Evaluation, etc.)
- **Rich Data Display**: Shows filename, score, date, and finding counts

**Integration Points**:
- Connected to main window via signals (`document_selected`, `document_reanalyzed`)
- Integrated with report export system
- Connected to analysis pipeline for reanalysis requests

## Technical Implementation

### Signal-Slot Architecture
```python
# Findings List Signals
finding_selected = Signal(dict)  # Emit when finding is selected
finding_disputed = Signal(str)   # Emit when finding is disputed

# Document History Signals
document_selected = Signal(dict)  # Emit when document is selected
document_reanalyzed = Signal(str) # Emit when reanalysis is requested
```

### Main Window Integration
- **Signal Handlers**: Added comprehensive signal handling methods
- **Filter Controls**: Integrated filter UI components with signal connections
- **Sample Data**: Added demonstration data loading for immediate functionality
- **Error Handling**: Robust error handling with user feedback via status bar

### Styling and UX
