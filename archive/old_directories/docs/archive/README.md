# Archived Documentation

The files in this directory have been archived as of October 2025. They are preserved for historical context but are no longer considered part of the active project documentation.

## Reason for Archiving

These documents were moved here for one of the following reasons:

-   **Redundant**: The information was duplicated in other, more current documents.
-   **Outdated**: The content described features or processes that are no longer in use.
-   **Consolidated**: The relevant information has been merged into the main project `README.md` or other primary documentation guides in the parent `docs/` directory.

Please refer to the root `README.md` for the most current and accurate information about the project.
