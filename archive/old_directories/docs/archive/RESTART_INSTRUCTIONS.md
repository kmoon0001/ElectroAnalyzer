## ✅ All Changes Saved & Committed

Everything is safely saved to git. You can shut down now!

## 🔄 When You Restart:

### Step 1: Clear Python Cache
```bash
# Delete cached Python files
Remove-Item -Recurse -Force __pycache__, .pytest_cache, src/__pycache__, src/*/__pycache__
```

### Step 2: Restart the Application
```bash
python start_app.py
```

### Step 3: What Will Happen
- ✅ App will start normally
- 🧠 **TheBloke/meditron-7B-GGUF (Q4_K_M)** will load (~4GB) on first run
- ✅ Expect the quantized weights at models/meditron/meditron-7b.Q4_K_M.gguf
- ✅ Once downloaded, all AI features will work:
  - AI-generated text recommendations ✅
  - AI chat assistant ✅
  - Fact checking ✅

## 📊 Current Status

### Working Features ✅

## 🔧 If Issues Persist

If the Meditron quantized model encounters issues, we have backup options:

### Option A: Enable Mock Mode
Change in `config.yaml`:
```yaml
use_ai_mocks: true  # Use mocks instead of real LLM
```
