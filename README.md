# Therapy Compliance Analyzer

## ðŸŒŸ Overview

This project is an advanced, AI-powered desktop application designed to help clinical therapists analyze documentation for compliance with Medicare and other regulatory guidelines. It uses a suite of local AI models to provide in-depth analysis, personalized feedback, and historical trend tracking, all while ensuring data privacy by processing everything on the user's machine.

This document provides a high-level overview of the project, including its features and architecture. For detailed instructions on how to install, configure, and run the application, please see the [Quick Start Guide](QUICK_START.md).

## âœ¨ Key Features

- **Secure User Authentication**: A robust login system with password management ensures secure access.
- **Interactive Dashboard**: Visualize compliance trends over time with a historical score chart and see a breakdown of the most common compliance issues.
- **AI-Powered Analysis Pipeline**:
    - **Advanced Preprocessing**: Includes a medical spell-checker to clean and correct text before analysis.
    - **Document Classification**: Automatically determines the document type (e.g., "Progress Note", "Evaluation") to provide better context to the AI.
    - **Hybrid Semantic Search**: A sophisticated RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) pipeline uses a hybrid of keyword and semantic search to find the most relevant compliance rules for a given document.
    - **NLG for Personalized Tips**: The AI generates personalized, actionable tips for each finding, going beyond generic suggestions.
- **Enhanced Risk Scoring**: A weighted algorithm calculates a more meaningful compliance score based on the severity and financial impact of each finding.
- **Ethical & Transparent AI**:
    - **Uncertainty Handling**: The system flags and visually highlights findings the AI is not confident about.
    - **Formalized Limitations**: Every report includes a clear disclaimer about the capabilities and limitations of the AI models.
- **Database-Backed Rubric Manager**: A full GUI for adding, editing, and deleting compliance rubrics, with all changes immediately reflected in the analysis engine.
- **Automated Database Maintenance**: The application automatically purges old reports to manage disk space usage.

### User Interface & Experience
- **Modern, Responsive UI**: A clean and professional interface that provides a seamless user experience.
- **Real-time Status Indicators**: Live feedback on AI model status and system performance.
- **Theme Support**: Switch between light and dark modes to suit your preference.
- **Smart Chat Assistant**: An AI-powered assistant to help with compliance-related questions.
- **Enhanced Reporting**:
    - **Dynamic HTML Reports**: Generate detailed compliance reports from the analysis data.
    - **Risk Assessment**: Color-coded risk levels (High, Medium, Low) with detailed scoring.
    - **Interactive Findings**: Clickable findings that provide detailed explanations and suggestions.

## ðŸ“‚ Project Architecture

The application is composed of a Python backend API and a desktop GUI.

- **Backend**: A modular API built with **FastAPI** that handles the AI analysis, database interactions, and user authentication.
- **Frontend**: A desktop application built with **PyQt6** that provides the user interface for document analysis and dashboard visualization.
- **Database**: Uses **SQLAlchemy** with a SQLite database to store user data, rubrics, and historical analysis reports.
