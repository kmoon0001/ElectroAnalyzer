# Therapy Compliance Analyzer

This project is an advanced, AI-powered desktop application designed to help clinical therapists analyze documentation for compliance with Medicare and other regulatory guidelines. It uses a suite of local AI models to provide in-depth analysis, personalized feedback, and historical trend tracking, all while ensuring data privacy by processing everything on the user's machine.

## ðŸŒŸ Key Features

- **Secure User Authentication**: A robust login system with password management ensures secure access.
- **Interactive Dashboard**: Visualize compliance trends over time with a historical score chart and see a breakdown of the most common compliance issues.
- **AI-Powered Analysis Pipeline**:
    - **Advanced Preprocessing**: Includes a medical spell-checker to clean and correct text before analysis.
    - **Document Classification**: Automatically determines the document type (e.g., "Progress Note", "Evaluation") to provide better context to the AI.
    - **Hybrid Semantic Search**: A sophisticated RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) pipeline uses a hybrid of keyword and semantic search to find the most relevant compliance rules for a given document.
    - **NLG for Personalized Tips**: The AI generates personalized, actionable tips for each finding, going beyond generic suggestions.
- **Enhanced Risk Scoring**: A weighted algorithm calculates a more meaningful compliance score based on the severity and financial impact of each finding.
- **Ethical & Transparent AI**:
    - **Uncertainty Handling**: The system flags and visually highlights findings the AI is not confident about.
    - **Formalized Limitations**: Every report includes a clear disclaimer about the capabilities and limitations of the AI models.
- **Database-Backed Rubric Manager**: A full GUI for adding, editing, and deleting compliance rubrics, with all changes immediately reflected in the analysis engine.
- **Automated Database Maintenance**: The application automatically purges old reports to manage disk space usage.

## ðŸ“‚ Project Architecture

The application is composed of a Python backend API and a desktop GUI.

- **Backend**: A modular API built with **FastAPI** that handles the AI analysis, database interactions, and user authentication.
- **Frontend**: A desktop application built with **PyQt6** that provides the user interface for document analysis and dashboard visualization.
- **Database**: Uses **SQLAlchemy** with a SQLite database to store user data, rubrics, and historical analysis reports.

## ðŸš€ Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- **Python 3.10+** and **pip**.
- **Git** for cloning the repository.

### 1. Installation

Clone the repository and install the required dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 2. Configuration (Crucial Step)

This application requires environment variables for database and security key configuration. The easiest way to manage this is with a `.env` file.

1.  **Create a `.env` file** in the root directory of the project.
2.  **Add the following lines** to the file:

    ```
    # The path to your SQLite database file
    DATABASE_URL="sqlite:///./compliance.db"

    # A secret key for encoding JWT tokens. Generate a new one for your instance.
    # You can generate one with: openssl rand -hex 32
    SECRET_KEY="YOUR_SUPER_SECRET_KEY_HERE"

    # The algorithm for JWT encoding
    ALGORITHM="HS256"

    # Token expiration time in minutes
    ACCESS_TOKEN_EXPIRE_MINUTES=30
    ```

3.  **Create a default user**: The application requires at least one user to log in. You will need to create one manually in the database for the first run.

### 3. Running the Application

You must run both the backend API and the GUI application.

**A. Run the Backend API:**

Open a terminal and run the following command from the project root:

```bash
# The --reload flag is great for development, as it restarts the server on code changes.
uvicorn src.api.main:app --reload
```

The API will be accessible at `http://127.0.0.1:8000`.

**B. Run the GUI Application:**

Open a *second* terminal and run the following command from the project root:

```bash
# Run the GUI as a module
python -m src.main
```

The GUI application will start, and you will be prompted to log in.

## ðŸ§ª Running Tests

To run the full suite of fast, isolated unit tests, use `pytest`:

```bash
pytest
```

## ðŸ“– API Documentation

The API documentation is automatically generated by FastAPI and is available at `http://127.0.0.1:8000/docs` after you have started the backend API.
