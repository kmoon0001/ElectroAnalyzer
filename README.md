# Clinical Compliance Analyzer

This project is a desktop application for analyzing clinical documents for compliance with a set of rules. It also includes a backend API for a web-based version of the tool.

## ðŸŒŸ Key Features

- **GUI Application**: A desktop application built with PySide6 for analyzing documents.
- **Backend API**: A backend API built with FastAPI for a web-based version of the tool.
- **Document Parsing**: Supports parsing of various document formats, including PDF and DOCX.
- **Compliance Analysis**: Analyzes documents against a set of rules defined in a rubric.
- **Medicare Guidelines**: Searches for relevant Medicare guidelines based on the analysis findings.
- **Performance Optimization**: Supports model quantization and CPU/RAM profiling to improve performance on low-end computers.
- **Reviewer Difficulty Levels**: Allows users to select between "moderate" and "strict" reviewer difficulty levels.
- **Folder Processing**: Allows users to process an entire folder of documents at once.
