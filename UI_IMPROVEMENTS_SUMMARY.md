def chat_button_mouse_move(self, event):
    """Handle chat button mouse move for dragging"""
    if self.chat_button_dragging and self.chat_button_offset:
        # Calculate new position with bounds checking
        new_pos = self.mapFromGlobal(event.globalPosition().toPoint()) - self.chat_button_offset
        # Keep button within window bounds
        max_x = self.width() - self.chat_button.width()
        max_y = self.height() - self.chat_button.height()
        new_x = max(0, min(new_pos.x(), max_x))
