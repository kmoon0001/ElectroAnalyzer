# Performance Features Guide

## Overview

The Therapy Compliance Analyzer now includes comprehensive performance management features designed to optimize the application for different hardware configurations while maintaining excellent user experience.

## Key Features

### ðŸŽ¯ Adaptive Performance Profiles

The application automatically detects your system capabilities and applies optimal settings:

- **Conservative Profile** (6-8GB RAM): CPU-only processing, quantized models, minimal cache
- **Balanced Profile** (8-12GB RAM): GPU optional, moderate cache, efficient processing  
- **Aggressive Profile** (12-16GB+ RAM): Full GPU acceleration, large cache, maximum performance

### ðŸ“Š Real-time Performance Monitoring

- **Status Bar Widget**: Shows current performance profile, memory usage, and system status
- **Performance Settings Dialog**: Comprehensive configuration and monitoring interface
- **System Information**: Detailed hardware detection and recommendations

### ðŸš€ Automatic Optimization

- **Pre-Analysis Optimization**: Automatically optimizes system before running document analysis
- **Memory Management**: Intelligent cache cleanup when memory usage gets high
- **Adaptive Batching**: Adjusts processing batch sizes based on current system load

## How to Use

### Accessing Performance Settings

1. **Menu Access**: Go to `Tools â†’ Performance Settings`
2. **Status Bar**: Click the âš™ button in the performance status widget
3. **Auto-Detection**: Use "Auto-Detect Optimal" to automatically configure settings

### Performance Status Widget

Located in the status bar, this widget shows:
- Current performance profile (Conservative/Balanced/Aggressive)
- Real-time memory usage bar with color coding
- System status (Optimal/Moderate/High Load)
- Quick access to performance settings

### Performance Settings Dialog

The comprehensive settings dialog includes three tabs:

#### Performance Profiles Tab
- Select from predefined profiles or create custom settings
- View system recommendations based on your hardware
- See expected performance impact for each profile

#### Advanced Settings Tab
- Fine-tune memory management (cache sizes, limits)
- Configure AI/ML settings (GPU usage, quantization, batch sizes)
- Adjust processing settings (parallel processing, workers, chunk sizes)
- Database configuration (connection pooling)

#### System Monitor Tab
- Real-time system information and hardware detection
- Live monitoring of memory usage and performance metrics
- Performance recommendations based on current system state

## Performance Optimization Features

### Intelligent Caching System

- **Memory-Aware**: Automatically adjusts cache size based on available system memory
- **Specialized Caches**: Separate caches for embeddings, NER results, LLM responses, and documents
- **Automatic Cleanup**: Removes old entries when memory pressure is detected
- **Performance Tracking**: Monitors cache hit rates and memory usage

### AI/ML Optimizations

- **GPU Acceleration**: Automatic detection and utilization of CUDA-capable GPUs
- **Model Quantization**: 4-bit quantization for 50% memory reduction with minimal accuracy loss
- **Adaptive Batching**: Dynamic batch size adjustment based on current memory usage
- **Parallel Processing**: Multi-threaded document processing when system resources allow

### Database Performance

- **Connection Pooling**: Configurable connection pool sizes for optimal database performance
- **Async Operations**: Non-blocking database operations to keep UI responsive
- **Automatic Indexing**: Optimized database queries with proper indexing
- **Maintenance Jobs**: Scheduled cleanup and optimization tasks

## Best Practices

### For Different System Types

**Business Laptops (6-8GB RAM)**:
- Use Conservative profile
- Enable model quantization
- Keep cache sizes small (1GB or less)
- Disable parallel processing if system feels slow

**Workstations (8-12GB RAM)**:
- Use Balanced profile (default)
- Enable GPU acceleration if available
- Moderate cache sizes (2GB)
- Enable parallel processing

**High-End Systems (12-16GB+ RAM)**:
- Use Aggressive profile
- Full GPU acceleration
- Large cache sizes (4GB+)
- Maximum parallel processing

### Monitoring and Maintenance

1. **Watch Memory Usage**: Keep system memory below 80% for optimal performance
2. **Monitor Cache Hit Rates**: Higher hit rates (70%+) indicate good cache efficiency
3. **Regular Optimization**: Run performance optimization before large analysis batches
4. **Update Settings**: Adjust settings if you upgrade hardware or notice performance issues

## Troubleshooting

### High Memory Usage
- Switch to Conservative profile
- Reduce cache sizes in Advanced Settings
- Close other applications during analysis
- Enable automatic cleanup

### Slow Analysis Performance
- Switch to Aggressive profile (if system supports it)
- Enable GPU acceleration
- Increase batch sizes
- Enable parallel processing

### System Freezing
- Reduce max workers in Advanced Settings
- Disable parallel processing
- Lower chunk sizes
- Restart application to reset caches

## Integration with Analysis Workflow

The performance system is seamlessly integrated into the document analysis workflow:

1. **Pre-Analysis**: System automatically optimizes performance before starting analysis
2. **During Analysis**: Real-time monitoring ensures optimal resource usage
3. **Post-Analysis**: Automatic cleanup prevents memory buildup
4. **Recommendations**: System provides suggestions for improving performance

## Technical Details

### Performance Profiles Configuration

Each profile includes optimized settings for:
- Memory management (cache sizes, limits)
- AI/ML processing (GPU usage, quantization, batch sizes)
- Database operations (connection pooling, async operations)
- Document processing (chunk sizes, parallel processing)

### Monitoring Metrics

The system tracks:
- System memory usage percentage
- Process memory usage in MB
- Cache memory usage and hit rates
- GPU availability and utilization
- Processing times and throughput

### Automatic Optimizations

The system automatically:
- Cleans up caches when memory usage exceeds 80%
- Adjusts batch sizes based on current system load
- Switches to more conservative settings under memory pressure
- Provides recommendations for performance improvements

This comprehensive performance management system ensures that the Therapy Compliance Analyzer runs efficiently on a wide range of hardware configurations while providing the best possible user experience.
