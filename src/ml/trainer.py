    This function orchestrates the model fine-tuning process using user feedback.

    This is a placeholder for the actual implementation. In a production system,
    this function would be called periodically (e.g., by a scheduled job)
    to continuously improve the model.

    The process would be as follows:
    1.  Fetch recent, verified feedback from the database.
        - This would involve querying the `feedback_annotations` table for
          entries that haven't been processed yet.

    2.  Prepare the feedback data for training.
        - This might involve transforming the feedback into a format that the
          model can understand (e.g., a dataset of "problematic_text" and
          "corrected_text" pairs).

    3.  Load the current machine learning model.
        - This could be a model from a file or a model registry.

    4.  Fine-tune the model using the prepared feedback data.
        - This would involve using a library like PyTorch or TensorFlow to
          continue training the model on the new data.

    5.  Evaluate the newly fine-tuned model.
        - It's crucial to have a validation set to ensure that the model
          is improving and not overfitting to the new data.

    6.  Deploy the new model.
        - If the evaluation is successful, the new model would be saved and
          would replace the old one in the production environment.
