**CONTEXT:**

**SOURCE DOCUMENT:**

**APPLICABLE GUIDELINES:**

{context}

**PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:**
Analyze the Source Document against the Applicable Guidelines. Identify all compliance risks and documentation strengths. Your entire output must be a single, valid JSON object, without any additional explanatory text or markdown.

**JSON OUTPUT STRUCTURE:**
Adhere strictly to this JSON format. Do not add or omit fields.
```json
{{
  "summary": "A concise, two-sentence summary of the document's overall compliance status.",
  "findings": [
    {{
      "rule_id": "<The specific rule identifier from the guidelines, or 'ad-hoc' if not rule-based>",
      "issue_title": "<A brief, descriptive title for the finding>",
      "text": "<The exact, verbatim quote from the document that illustrates the finding>",
      "regulation": "<The specific citation or source from the provided guidelines that supports this finding>",
      "confidence": <A float between 0.0 and 1.0 representing your confidence in this finding's accuracy>,
      "personalized_tip": "<A concrete, actionable recommendation for the clinician to improve this specific documentation point>",
      "severity_reason": "<A clear explanation of why this finding is important (e.g., billing risk, patient safety, audit trigger)>",
      "priority": "<'High', 'Medium', or 'Low', based on the potential impact of the finding>"
    }}
  ],
  "citations": ["<A list of all guideline sections or regulations referenced in the findings>"]
}}
```

**CRITICAL DIRECTIVES:**
1.  **Verbatim Quotes:** The `"text"` field *must* be an exact quote from the source document. Do not paraphrase or alter it.
2.  **Evidence-Based:** Every finding must be directly supported by evidence from the document and a corresponding guideline. Do not infer or invent information.
3.  **Confidence Score:** If the evidence is ambiguous or weak, reflect this with a `confidence` score below 0.6 and explain the uncertainty in the `severity_reason`.
4.  **Actionable Tips:** Recommendations in `"personalized_tip"` must be practical and provide clear, ready-to-use examples for correction where appropriate.
5.  **Strict JSON:** The final output must be *only* the JSON object. Do not include any introductory text, closing remarks, or markdown formatting like `json`.
