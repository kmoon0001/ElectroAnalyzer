### AI Model Limitations and Important Disclaimers

**1. Not a Substitute for Professional Judgment:**
This tool is designed to assist, not replace, the expertise of a qualified healthcare professional. All findings and suggestions should be critically reviewed by a human expert before any clinical decisions are made.

**2. Potential for Inaccuracies:**
The AI models used in this application, like all language models, can produce inaccurate, incomplete, or nonsensical information (a phenomenon known as "hallucination"). The analysis should be treated as a preliminary screening, not as a definitive compliance audit.

**3. Inherent Biases:**
The models were trained on large datasets of text from the internet and specific medical corpora. They may have inherent biases from this training data, which could affect the analysis of documentation related to certain demographics or conditions.

**4. Scope of Knowledge:**
The analysis is limited to the specific compliance rules and guidelines that the system has been configured with. It is not aware of all possible local, state, or federal regulations, nor of specific private payer policies.

**5. Uncertainty:**
The system does not currently provide a confidence score for its findings. All findings should be treated with the same level of scrutiny, regardless of how they are worded.
