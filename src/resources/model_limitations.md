### AI Model Limitations and Clinical Disclaimers

**1. Professional Judgment Required:**
This AI system is designed as a clinical decision support tool, not a replacement for professional healthcare expertise. All findings must be validated by qualified healthcare professionals before implementation. The system cannot account for patient-specific clinical context, provider judgment, or real-time clinical situations.

**2. Accuracy and Reliability Limitations:**
AI language models can produce inaccurate, incomplete, or contextually inappropriate information (AI "hallucinations"). This analysis represents a preliminary screening tool and should never be considered a definitive compliance audit. All findings require human verification and clinical correlation.

**3. Training Data Biases:**
The AI models were trained on large healthcare datasets that may contain inherent biases related to demographics, geographic regions, practice patterns, or historical documentation standards. Users should be aware that analysis may reflect these biases and should apply additional scrutiny to findings involving diverse patient populations.

**4. Regulatory Scope Limitations:**
This system is configured with specific Medicare/CMS guidelines and professional therapy standards current as of the training date. It may not reflect:
- Recent regulatory updates or changes
- State-specific requirements or local regulations
- Private payer policies or requirements
- Facility-specific protocols or standards
- Emerging best practices or clinical guidelines

**5. Confidence and Uncertainty Indicators:**
The system provides confidence indicators for its findings, but these should be interpreted cautiously. Low-confidence findings require additional review, while high-confidence findings still require professional validation. The absence of a confidence indicator does not guarantee accuracy.

**6. Privacy and Security Considerations:**
While the system includes PHI scrubbing capabilities, users must ensure compliance with HIPAA and other privacy regulations. This tool processes data locally to maintain privacy, but users remain responsible for appropriate data handling and security measures.

**7. Clinical Context Limitations:**
The AI cannot access or interpret:
- Patient medical history or comorbidities
- Clinical reasoning behind documentation decisions
- Verbal communications or non-documented care
- Patient-specific circumstances affecting care delivery
- Provider expertise and clinical judgment factors
