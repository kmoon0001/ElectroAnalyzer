- Added 5 comprehensive sections:
  - User Preferences (theme, account, UI)
  - Analysis Settings (7 toggles for features)
  - Report Settings (8 checkboxes for sections)
  - Performance Settings (caching, threads, cleanup)
  - Admin Settings (advanced configuration)
- Result: Fully functional settings management

### 4. Layout Redesign 🏗️
**Problem**: Layout was cluttered with docks and panels.

**Solution**:
- Removed auto-analysis dock (now popup)
- Removed document preview dock (now popup)
- Removed report preview panel (now popup)
- Clean 3-column layout: Upload/Settings | Report Sections | Results
- Result: Organized, spacious, professional layout

### 5. PDF Export Implementation 📄
**Problem**: PDF export was not implemented (TODO comment).

**Solution**:
- Integrated PDFExportService
- Added proper error handling
- User-friendly messages for missing dependencies
- Automatic file copying to user's chosen location
- Result: Fully functional PDF export

### 6. Code Cleanup 🧹
**Problem**: Code had unused features and TODOs.

**Solution**:
- Removed unused auto-analysis queue code
- Removed unused document preview dock code
- Removed unused report preview panel code
- Fixed missing logger import
- Optimized worker thread management
- Result: Clean, maintainable codebase
