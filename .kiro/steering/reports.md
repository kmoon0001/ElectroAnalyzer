# Clinical Compliance Report Standards

This steering document defines the comprehensive structure and requirements for compliance reports generated by the Therapy Compliance Analyzer. All report generation code must adhere to these standards to ensure clinical utility, regulatory compliance, and ethical AI transparency.

## Report Structure Requirements

### Essential Components (Must Include)
- **Executive Summary Dashboard** with risk-weighted compliance scoring
- **Detailed Findings Table** with evidence, recommendations, and confidence indicators
- **AI Transparency Section** with model limitations and ethical disclaimers
- **Regulatory Citations** with specific Medicare/CMS and professional standard references
- **Action Planning Section** with immediate and long-term improvement recommendations

### Interactive Features (Should Include)
- **Source Document Highlighting** with click-to-navigate functionality
- **AI Chat Integration** for finding clarification and additional guidance
- **Confidence Indicators** with visual uncertainty markers for low-confidence findings
- **Dispute Mechanisms** allowing users to flag incorrect findings for model improvement

### Quality Standards
- **PHI Protection**: All reports must use PHI scrubbing with [REDACTED] placeholders
- **Professional Language**: Clinical terminology appropriate for healthcare professionals
- **Actionable Content**: Every finding must include specific, implementable recommendations
- **Evidence-Based**: All compliance issues must cite specific regulations or standards

## Implementation Guidelines

### Report Generation Service
- Use `src/core/report_generator.py` as the primary report creation service
- Integrate with `src/core/nlg_service.py` for personalized recommendation generation
- Apply `src/core/phi_scrubber.py` for all text content before report inclusion
- Utilize `src/core/risk_scoring_service.py` for weighted compliance calculations

### Template Structure
- Base template: `src/resources/report_template.html`
- Responsive design supporting both screen and print formats
- Accessibility compliance (WCAG 2.1 AA standards)
- Professional medical document styling

### Data Integration
- Pull findings from `src/database/models.py` AnalysisResult entities
- Include user context from authentication system for personalization
- Reference rubric data from `src/resources/*.ttl` files for regulation citations
- Integrate historical data for trend analysis when available

## Reference Implementation
See `#[[file:REPORT_ELEMENTS.md]]` for the complete specification of report structure, elements, and interactive features that should be implemented in all compliance reports.
