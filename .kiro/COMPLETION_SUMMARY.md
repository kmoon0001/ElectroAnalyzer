## 📝 Known Limitations

1. **API Server Required**: Analysis requires FastAPI server running
   - Start with: `python run_api.py`
   - Or: `uvicorn src.api.main:app --reload`

2. **AI Models**: First run downloads models (~500MB)
   - Requires internet connection initially
   - Subsequent runs are offline

3. **Database**: SQLite database created on first run
   - Location: `./compliance.db`
   - Backup recommended for production

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

### Application Won't Start
- Check Python version (3.11+ required)
- Install dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
- Check for port conflicts (8001 for API)

### Analysis Hangs
- Ensure API server is running
- Check API server logs for errors
- Verify AI models downloaded successfully
- Try restarting both API and GUI

### Slow Performance
- Close other applications
- Increase worker threads in Settings
- Enable caching in Performance Settings
- Check available RAM (4GB+ recommended)
