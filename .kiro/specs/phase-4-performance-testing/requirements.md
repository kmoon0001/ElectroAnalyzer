5. WHEN multiple performance systems operate simultaneously THEN the system SHALL maintain optimal performance without conflicts

### Requirement 4: Benchmarking & Performance Comparison

**User Story:** As a performance engineer, I want standardized benchmarking tools, so that I can compare performance across different configurations and track improvements over time.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN benchmark tests are executed THEN the system SHALL run standardized performance scenarios
2. WHEN benchmark results are generated THEN the system SHALL provide statistical analysis with confidence intervals
3. WHEN performance comparisons are made THEN the system SHALL highlight significant improvements or regressions
4. WHEN historical benchmarks are analyzed THEN the system SHALL show performance trends over time
5. IF benchmark results indicate performance issues THEN the system SHALL provide specific optimization recommendations

### Requirement 5: Automated Performance Validation

**User Story:** As a continuous integration engineer, I want automated performance validation in the CI/CD pipeline, so that performance regressions are caught before deployment.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN code changes are committed THEN the system SHALL automatically run performance validation tests
2. WHEN performance thresholds are exceeded THEN the system SHALL fail the build with detailed error reports
3. WHEN performance improvements are detected THEN the system SHALL document and celebrate the improvements
4. WHEN performance tests complete THEN the system SHALL generate artifacts for performance tracking
5. IF performance validation fails THEN the system SHALL provide actionable feedback for developers

### Requirement 6: Real-world Scenario Testing

**User Story:** As a clinical user, I want performance testing with realistic clinical scenarios, so that I can be confident the system will perform well in actual usage conditions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN clinical document processing is tested THEN the system SHALL use realistic document sizes and complexity
2. WHEN multi-user scenarios are simulated THEN the system SHALL maintain response times within clinical workflow requirements
3. WHEN peak usage periods are simulated THEN the system SHALL handle load spikes without degradation
4. WHEN long-running analysis sessions are tested THEN the system SHALL maintain stable performance over extended periods
5. IF clinical performance requirements are not met THEN the system SHALL provide specific optimization strategies

### Requirement 7: Performance Monitoring Validation

**User Story:** As a system operator, I want validation of the performance monitoring system accuracy, so that I can trust the metrics and alerts for production monitoring.
