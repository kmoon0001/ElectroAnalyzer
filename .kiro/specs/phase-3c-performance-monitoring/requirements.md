# Requirements Document - Phase 3C: Advanced Performance Monitoring & Analytics

## Introduction

Phase 3C extends the Therapy Compliance Analyzer's performance optimization system with comprehensive monitoring, analytics, and intelligent insights. Building on the advanced caching (Phase 3A) and memory optimization (Phase 3B) foundations, this phase adds real-time monitoring, historical analytics, predictive insights, and automated performance recommendations.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Real-Time Performance Monitoring

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want real-time monitoring of system performance metrics, so that I can identify performance issues as they occur and take immediate action.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the system is running THEN the monitoring service SHALL collect performance metrics every 5 seconds
2. WHEN performance metrics are collected THEN the system SHALL track response times, throughput, error rates, and resource utilization
3. WHEN a performance threshold is exceeded THEN the system SHALL trigger alerts and notifications
4. WHEN monitoring data is requested THEN the system SHALL provide real-time metrics within 100ms
5. IF monitoring fails THEN the system SHALL continue operating with degraded monitoring capabilities

### Requirement 2: Historical Performance Analytics

**User Story:** As a developer, I want historical performance analytics and trend analysis, so that I can understand system behavior patterns and optimize long-term performance.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN performance data is collected THEN the system SHALL store historical metrics for at least 30 days
2. WHEN trend analysis is requested THEN the system SHALL provide performance trends over configurable time periods
3. WHEN analytics are generated THEN the system SHALL identify performance patterns, anomalies, and degradation trends
4. WHEN historical data exceeds retention limits THEN the system SHALL automatically archive or purge old data
5. IF analytics processing fails THEN the system SHALL provide cached or simplified analytics

### Requirement 3: Predictive Performance Insights

**User Story:** As a system operator, I want predictive insights about future performance issues, so that I can proactively address problems before they impact users.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN sufficient historical data exists THEN the system SHALL predict future performance trends
2. WHEN performance degradation is predicted THEN the system SHALL provide early warning alerts
3. WHEN capacity limits are approached THEN the system SHALL recommend scaling or optimization actions
4. WHEN seasonal patterns are detected THEN the system SHALL adjust predictions accordingly
5. IF prediction models fail THEN the system SHALL fall back to threshold-based monitoring

### Requirement 4: Automated Performance Recommendations

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want automated performance recommendations based on monitoring data, so that I can optimize system performance without deep technical expertise.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN performance issues are detected THEN the system SHALL generate specific optimization recommendations
2. WHEN recommendations are provided THEN they SHALL include expected impact, implementation difficulty, and risk assessment
3. WHEN multiple optimization options exist THEN the system SHALL prioritize recommendations by impact and feasibility
4. WHEN recommendations are implemented THEN the system SHALL track their effectiveness
5. IF recommendation generation fails THEN the system SHALL provide generic best practices

### Requirement 5: Performance Dashboard and Visualization

**User Story:** As a user, I want an intuitive performance dashboard with visualizations, so that I can quickly understand system performance status and trends.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the dashboard is accessed THEN it SHALL display current performance status within 2 seconds
2. WHEN performance data is visualized THEN it SHALL use appropriate charts, graphs, and indicators
3. WHEN dashboard elements are interactive THEN users SHALL be able to drill down into detailed metrics
4. WHEN dashboard data is outdated THEN it SHALL clearly indicate the last update time
5. IF dashboard rendering fails THEN it SHALL show a simplified status view

### Requirement 6: Performance Alerting and Notifications

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want configurable alerts for performance issues, so that I can be notified of problems through my preferred communication channels.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN performance thresholds are exceeded THEN the system SHALL send alerts through configured channels
2. WHEN alerts are configured THEN users SHALL be able to set custom thresholds and notification preferences
3. WHEN multiple alerts occur THEN the system SHALL implement rate limiting and alert aggregation
4. WHEN alerts are resolved THEN the system SHALL send resolution notifications
5. IF alerting fails THEN the system SHALL log alerts for manual review

### Requirement 7: Performance Benchmarking and Comparison

**User Story:** As a developer, I want performance benchmarking capabilities, so that I can compare system performance across different configurations and time periods.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN benchmarks are requested THEN the system SHALL run standardized performance tests
2. WHEN benchmark results are available THEN they SHALL be comparable across different system states
3. WHEN performance comparisons are made THEN the system SHALL highlight significant differences
4. WHEN benchmark data is stored THEN it SHALL be tagged with system configuration metadata
5. IF benchmarking fails THEN the system SHALL provide diagnostic information

### Requirement 8: Integration with Existing Performance Systems

**User Story:** As a system integrator, I want the monitoring system to integrate with existing performance optimization components, so that all performance features work together seamlessly.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN monitoring detects issues THEN it SHALL trigger appropriate optimization actions
2. WHEN optimization actions are taken THEN their effects SHALL be reflected in monitoring data
3. WHEN cache performance changes THEN it SHALL be tracked in the monitoring system
4. WHEN memory optimization occurs THEN its impact SHALL be measured and reported
5. IF integration fails THEN each system SHALL continue operating independently
