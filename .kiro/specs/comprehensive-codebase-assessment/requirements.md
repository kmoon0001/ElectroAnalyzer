# Comprehensive Codebase Assessment Requirements

## Introduction

This specification addresses a comprehensive evaluation and remediation of the Therapy Compliance Analyzer codebase across all software development dimensions. The assessment has identified critical issues in code quality, architecture, security, performance, and maintainability that must be systematically addressed to prepare the application for production deployment.

6. WHEN examining file organization THEN the system SHALL have consistent module structure following the established patterns

### Requirement 3: Database Schema and Model Consistency

**User Story:** As a database administrator, I want the database schema to be consistent and properly defined, so that data integrity is maintained and queries are efficient.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN examining database models THEN the system SHALL have all referenced models properly defined (Rubric, Report, Finding)
2. WHEN reviewing relationships THEN the system SHALL have proper foreign key constraints and cascade operations
3. WHEN analyzing CRUD operations THEN the system SHALL have consistent async/await patterns for all database operations
4. WHEN checking schema definitions THEN the system SHALL have proper indexing for frequently queried fields
5. WHEN reviewing data validation THEN the system SHALL have consistent Pydantic schema validation for all API inputs

### Requirement 4: Security and Privacy Compliance

**User Story:** As a security officer, I want the application to meet healthcare data security standards, so that patient information is protected and regulatory compliance is maintained.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN processing documents THEN the system SHALL properly scrub all PHI before logging or error reporting
2. WHEN handling authentication THEN the system SHALL use secure JWT token management with proper expiration
3. WHEN managing dependencies THEN the system SHALL have no known security vulnerabilities in third-party packages
4. WHEN storing sensitive data THEN the system SHALL use proper encryption for passwords and sensitive information
5. WHEN handling API requests THEN the system SHALL have proper rate limiting and input validation
6. WHEN processing user input THEN the system SHALL sanitize all inputs to prevent injection attacks

### Requirement 5: Performance and Resource Management

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want the application to use system resources efficiently, so that it can handle production workloads without performance degradation.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN loading AI models THEN the system SHALL implement proper lazy loading and memory management
2. WHEN processing documents THEN the system SHALL use efficient caching strategies for embeddings and model outputs
3. WHEN handling concurrent requests THEN the system SHALL manage thread safety for shared resources
4. WHEN performing database operations THEN the system SHALL use connection pooling and query optimization
5. WHEN managing temporary files THEN the system SHALL implement automatic cleanup to prevent disk space issues
6. WHEN monitoring system health THEN the system SHALL provide performance metrics and resource usage indicators

### Requirement 6: Error Handling and Logging

**User Story:** As a system operator, I want comprehensive error handling and logging, so that issues can be quickly identified and resolved without exposing sensitive information.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN errors occur THEN the system SHALL provide meaningful error messages without exposing internal details
2. WHEN logging events THEN the system SHALL never log PHI or sensitive user information
3. WHEN handling exceptions THEN the system SHALL have consistent error handling patterns across all modules
4. WHEN API errors occur THEN the system SHALL return appropriate HTTP status codes with helpful error details
5. WHEN system failures happen THEN the system SHALL implement graceful degradation where possible
6. WHEN debugging issues THEN the system SHALL provide sufficient logging detail for troubleshooting

### Requirement 7: Testing Coverage and Quality

**User Story:** As a quality assurance engineer, I want comprehensive test coverage, so that the system is reliable and regressions are caught early.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN running unit tests THEN the system SHALL have >80% code coverage for core business logic
2. WHEN executing integration tests THEN the system SHALL test all API endpoints with realistic scenarios
3. WHEN performing GUI tests THEN the system SHALL test critical user workflows with pytest-qt
4. WHEN running performance tests THEN the system SHALL validate system behavior under load
5. WHEN testing error conditions THEN the system SHALL have tests for all major error scenarios
6. WHEN validating security THEN the system SHALL have tests for authentication and authorization flows

### Requirement 8: Dependency Management and Updates

**User Story:** As a DevOps engineer, I want proper dependency management, so that the system uses secure, up-to-date packages without compatibility issues.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN reviewing dependencies THEN the system SHALL have all packages updated to secure, compatible versions
2. WHEN managing requirements THEN the system SHALL have proper version pinning for reproducible builds
3. WHEN checking compatibility THEN the system SHALL have no conflicting package versions
