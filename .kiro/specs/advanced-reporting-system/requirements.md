5. IF compliance violations are found THEN the system SHALL prioritize issues by severity and regulatory impact

### Requirement 4: Executive Summary Reports

**User Story:** As an executive, I want high-level summary reports, so that I can understand system performance and compliance status without technical details.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN executive reports are requested THEN the system SHALL provide high-level summaries with key performance indicators
2. WHEN business impact is assessed THEN the system SHALL translate technical metrics into business value and ROI
3. WHEN strategic decisions are needed THEN the system SHALL provide recommendations with cost-benefit analysis
4. WHEN progress is tracked THEN the system SHALL show improvement trends and goal achievement status
5. IF critical issues exist THEN the system SHALL highlight business risks and mitigation strategies

### Requirement 5: Automated Report Generation

**User Story:** As a system operator, I want automated report generation, so that reports are created consistently and delivered to stakeholders without manual intervention.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN report schedules are configured THEN the system SHALL automatically generate reports at specified intervals
2. WHEN report criteria are met THEN the system SHALL trigger automatic report generation with appropriate content
3. WHEN reports are generated THEN the system SHALL automatically distribute reports to configured recipients
4. WHEN report templates are updated THEN the system SHALL apply changes to future automated reports
5. IF report generation fails THEN the system SHALL provide error notifications and retry mechanisms

### Requirement 6: Multi-format Report Export

**User Story:** As a report consumer, I want reports in multiple formats, so that I can use reports in different contexts and share them with various stakeholders.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN reports are exported THEN the system SHALL support PDF, HTML, Excel, and JSON formats
2. WHEN PDF reports are generated THEN the system SHALL provide professional formatting with charts and tables
3. WHEN HTML reports are created THEN the system SHALL include interactive elements and responsive design
4. WHEN Excel reports are exported THEN the system SHALL provide structured data with formulas and charts
5. IF custom formats are needed THEN the system SHALL provide extensible export framework for additional formats

### Requirement 7: Report Customization and Templates

**User Story:** As a report administrator, I want customizable report templates, so that I can tailor reports to specific audiences and organizational requirements.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN report templates are created THEN the system SHALL provide flexible template design with drag-and-drop components
2. WHEN templates are customized THEN the system SHALL allow branding, styling, and content configuration
3. WHEN template libraries are managed THEN the system SHALL provide version control and template sharing
4. WHEN reports are generated THEN the system SHALL apply appropriate templates based on report type and audience
5. IF template validation is needed THEN the system SHALL verify template integrity and data compatibility

### Requirement 8: Historical Report Analytics

**User Story:** As a data analyst, I want historical report analytics, so that I can identify long-term trends and patterns in system performance and compliance.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN historical analysis is performed THEN the system SHALL provide trend analysis across multiple time periods
2. WHEN pattern recognition is needed THEN the system SHALL identify recurring issues and improvement opportunities
3. WHEN comparative analysis is requested THEN the system SHALL compare performance across different time periods and configurations
