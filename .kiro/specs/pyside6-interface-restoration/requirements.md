# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature aims to restore the PySide6 interface to its state before the Mission Control, Meta Analytics, and Performance Status widgets were activated. The activation of these widgets unexpectedly changed the entire interface layout. 

The desired interface layout:
- **Main window with 4 tabs**: Analysis, Dashboard, Mission Control, and Settings
- **Analysis tab - Left side**: Three smaller windows for Rubric selection, Report preview, and Report outputs
- **Analysis tab - Right side**: Chat and Analysis window
- **Mission Control tab**: Full Mission Control widget for task monitoring and system management
- **Meta Analytics and Performance Status**: Accessible via Tools menu as dock widgets

The goal is to restore the original Analysis tab layout, add Mission Control as its own tab, and make Meta Analytics and Performance Status available without disrupting the main interface.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Main Window Tab Structure Restoration

**User Story:** As a user, I want the right side of the interface to show the Chat and Analysis window, so that I can interact with AI assistance and view analysis results in the familiar location.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN viewing the Analysis tab THEN the system SHALL display the Chat and Analysis window on the right side
2. WHEN the user performs an analysis THEN the system SHALL display results in the right panel
3. WHEN the user opens the chat THEN the system SHALL display the chat interface in the right panel
4. WHEN the user switches between chat and analysis views THEN the system SHALL maintain the right panel layout structure

### Requirement 4: Feature Preservation

**User Story:** As a user, I want all current features to remain functional after the interface restoration, so that I don't lose any capabilities I currently use.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the interface is restored THEN the system SHALL preserve all document analysis functionality
2. WHEN the interface is restored THEN the system SHALL preserve all dashboard and analytics features
3. WHEN the interface is restored THEN the system SHALL preserve all rubric management capabilities
4. WHEN the interface is restored THEN the system SHALL preserve all chat and AI assistance features
5. WHEN the interface is restored THEN the system SHALL preserve all batch processing capabilities
6. WHEN the interface is restored THEN the system SHALL preserve all settings and configuration options
7. WHEN the interface is restored THEN the system SHALL preserve all reporting and export features

### Requirement 5: New Widget Integration

**User Story:** As a user, I want Mission Control as its own tab and Meta Analytics and Performance Status widgets accessible without disrupting the main interface, so that I can use new features while maintaining my familiar workflow.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user clicks the Mission Control tab THEN the system SHALL display the full Mission Control widget with task monitoring, logs, and settings
2. WHEN Meta Analytics is activated THEN the system SHALL make it accessible via Tools menu without altering the main window layout
3. WHEN Performance Status is activated THEN the system SHALL make it accessible via Tools menu or status bar without altering the main window layout
4. WHEN Meta Analytics or Performance Status are accessed THEN the system SHALL display them as dock widgets or separate dialogs
5. WHEN using the restored interface THEN the system SHALL maintain all background workers and async operations
6. WHEN using the restored interface THEN the system SHALL maintain the ViewModel pattern for state management

### Requirement 6: Visual Consistency

**User Story:** As a user, I want the restored interface to maintain visual consistency with the previous design, so that the application feels familiar and intuitive.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN viewing the application THEN the system SHALL use the previous color scheme and styling
2. WHEN viewing the application THEN the system SHALL use the previous widget layouts and spacing
3. WHEN viewing the application THEN the system SHALL use the previous icon set and visual elements
4. WHEN the user switches themes THEN the system SHALL apply themes consistently across the restored interface

### Requirement 7: Backward Compatibility

2. WHEN the restored interface loads THEN the system SHALL maintain compatibility with existing configuration files
3. WHEN the user saves settings THEN the system SHALL store them in a format compatible with the current system

### Requirement 8: Performance Maintenance

**User Story:** As a user, I want the restored interface to maintain or improve current performance levels, so that the application remains responsive and efficient.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN performing any operation THEN the system SHALL maintain current performance benchmarks
2. WHEN loading the interface THEN the system SHALL complete initialization within acceptable time limits
3. WHEN processing documents THEN the system SHALL maintain current processing speeds
4. WHEN displaying analytics THEN the system SHALL render visualizations without performance degradation
