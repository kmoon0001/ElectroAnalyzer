# Requirements Document - Improve Document Upload UI

## Introduction

The current document upload interface has usability issues that confuse users and provide poor feedback during the upload and analysis workflow. Users report that the interface text looks like it's describing an already uploaded document rather than prompting for upload, and there's no clear confirmation when files are uploaded or when analysis is initiated.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Clear Upload Prompting

**User Story:** As a therapist, I want the document upload area to clearly prompt me to upload a file when no document is selected, so that I understand what action I need to take.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN no document is selected THEN the file display area SHALL show a clear upload prompt with instructions
2. WHEN no document is selected THEN the prompt SHALL use action-oriented language like "Click to upload" or "Select a document"
3. WHEN no document is selected THEN the prompt SHALL clearly indicate supported file formats
4. WHEN no document is selected THEN the visual styling SHALL indicate an empty/waiting state

### Requirement 2: Clear Upload Confirmation

**User Story:** As a therapist, I want clear visual confirmation when I successfully upload a document, so that I know the file was loaded and I can proceed with analysis.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a document is successfully uploaded THEN the interface SHALL display a clear success message
2. WHEN a document is uploaded THEN the file display SHALL show the document name, size, and ready status
3. WHEN a document is uploaded THEN the status bar SHALL show a confirmation message
4. WHEN a document is uploaded THEN the analyze button SHALL become enabled with clear visual indication

### Requirement 3: Analysis Workflow Feedback

**User Story:** As a therapist, I want immediate feedback when I click the analyze button, so that I know the analysis has started and is progressing.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the analyze button is clicked THEN the interface SHALL immediately show analysis has started
2. WHEN analysis starts THEN the analyze button SHALL be disabled to prevent duplicate requests
3. WHEN analysis is in progress THEN progress indicators SHALL be visible and updating
4. WHEN analysis fails to start THEN clear error messages SHALL be displayed with next steps

### Requirement 4: Improved Visual States

**User Story:** As a therapist, I want the interface to clearly show different states (empty, loaded, analyzing, complete), so that I always understand what's happening and what I can do next.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the interface is in different states THEN each state SHALL have distinct visual styling
2. WHEN transitioning between states THEN the changes SHALL be smooth and clear
3. WHEN in any state THEN the available actions SHALL be clearly indicated
4. WHEN errors occur THEN the error state SHALL be visually distinct with recovery options

### Requirement 5: Better Error Communication

**User Story:** As a therapist, I want clear, actionable error messages when something goes wrong with upload or analysis, so that I can resolve issues and continue my work.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN file upload fails THEN the error message SHALL explain what went wrong and how to fix it
2. WHEN analysis fails to start THEN the error message SHALL include specific troubleshooting steps
3. WHEN the API is unavailable THEN the error message SHALL explain how to start the backend service
4. WHEN file format is unsupported THEN the error message SHALL list supported formats and conversion options
