# Requirements Document - Fix Analysis Workflow

## Introduction

The Therapy Compliance Analyzer's document analysis feature is currently not working properly. Users can upload documents and select rubrics, but when they click "Run Analysis", the process starts but never completes, leaving users with a perpetually running analysis that provides no results.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Analysis Process Diagnosis

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to identify why the analysis workflow fails to complete, so that I can fix the underlying issue.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the analysis workflow is triggered THEN the system SHALL log each step of the process
2. WHEN an analysis step fails THEN the system SHALL capture and report the specific error
3. WHEN the analysis hangs THEN the system SHALL identify which component is blocking completion
4. IF the API backend is not responding THEN the system SHALL detect and report the connection issue
5. IF the AI models are not loaded THEN the system SHALL report the model loading status

### Requirement 2: Analysis Workflow Completion

**User Story:** As a therapist, I want the document analysis to complete successfully, so that I can review compliance findings and recommendations.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I upload a document and click "Run Analysis" THEN the analysis SHALL complete within 2 minutes
2. WHEN the analysis completes THEN the system SHALL display results in the Summary tab
3. WHEN the analysis completes THEN the system SHALL enable the "View Report" button
4. IF the analysis fails THEN the system SHALL display a clear error message with troubleshooting steps
5. WHEN the analysis is running THEN the system SHALL show progress indicators and status updates

### Requirement 3: Error Handling and Recovery

**User Story:** As a user, I want clear feedback when analysis fails, so that I can understand what went wrong and how to fix it.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an analysis fails THEN the system SHALL display a user-friendly error message
2. WHEN an analysis times out THEN the system SHALL allow the user to retry
3. WHEN the API is unavailable THEN the system SHALL suggest checking the backend service
4. WHEN AI models fail to load THEN the system SHALL provide model troubleshooting guidance
5. WHEN an analysis is stuck THEN the system SHALL provide a "Cancel Analysis" option

### Requirement 4: Analysis Status Feedback

**User Story:** As a user, I want to see the progress of my analysis, so that I know the system is working and how long to wait.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN analysis starts THEN the system SHALL show "Analysis in progress..." status
2. WHEN analysis is processing THEN the system SHALL display a progress bar or spinner
3. WHEN analysis reaches different stages THEN the system SHALL update status messages
4. WHEN analysis completes THEN the system SHALL show "Analysis Complete" with success indicator
5. WHEN analysis fails THEN the system SHALL show "Analysis Failed" with error details

### Requirement 5: Backend Integration Verification

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to verify the frontend-backend integration works correctly, so that analysis requests are properly handled.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the GUI sends an analysis request THEN the API SHALL receive and acknowledge it
2. WHEN the API processes a document THEN it SHALL return a valid task ID
3. WHEN the GUI polls for results THEN the API SHALL provide status updates
4. WHEN analysis completes THEN the API SHALL return properly formatted results
5. WHEN there are API errors THEN they SHALL be properly propagated to the GUI
