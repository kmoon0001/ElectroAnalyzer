# Medicare: Skilled Care Checklist

## Patient Centered Care
- The plan of care must be established in consultation with the patient or their representative.
- Goals must be functional, measurable, and relevant to the patient's stated needs.

## Skilled Intervention Justification
- Daily notes must clearly document the need for the unique skills of a therapist.
- Services provided must be of a complexity that requires a qualified therapist.
- Documentation must describe the specific therapeutic interventions performed.
- Repetitive exercises or activities that the patient can perform independently are not considered skilled care.

## Progress and Expectations
- There must be a reasonable expectation of material improvement in a predictable period of time.
- Progress towards goals must be regularly documented.
- Lack of improvement must be addressed with a modified plan of care.
