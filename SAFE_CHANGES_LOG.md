# Safe Changes Log

## Changes Made (Non-Breaking)

### ✅ Change #1: Added Lucide Icons to Navigation
**File**: `frontend/electron-react-app/src/components/layout/ShellNavigation.tsx`

**What Changed**:
- Replaced text placeholders (A, D, MC, S) with proper Lucide React icons
- Used existing Lucide library (already installed, no new dependencies)
- Kept all existing CSS styling intact
- Kept all navigation structure and routing unchanged

**Icons Added**:
- Analysis: FileText icon
- Dashboard: BarChart3 icon
- Mission Control: Gauge icon
- Advanced Analytics: TrendingUp icon
- Team Analytics: Users icon
- Growth Journey: Sparkles icon
- Settings: Settings icon

**What Was NOT Changed**:
- ✅ All CSS styling preserved
- ✅ All routes preserved
- ✅ All navigation behavior preserved
- ✅ All hover/active states preserved
- ✅ Layout structure unchanged
- ✅ No API changes
- ✅ No backend changes

**How to Test**:
1. Restart the frontend (Ctrl+C and `npm run dev`)
2. Check that all navigation links still work
3. Icons should appear instead of text placeholders
4. All styling should look the same, just with icons

**Rollback** (if needed):
The original file is preserved. Just revert the changes to restore text icons.
