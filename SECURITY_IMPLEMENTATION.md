- **Rate Limiting**: Per-endpoint rate limits with burst protection
- **Security Headers**:
  - Content Security Policy (CSP)
  - X-Frame-Options: DENY
  - X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff
  - Strict-Transport-Security (HTTPS)
  - Cross-Origin policies
- **Request Validation**: Comprehensive request validation middleware

### 5. **Error Handling & Logging**
- **Error Sanitization**: Sensitive information removed from error messages
- **Structured Logging**: Comprehensive audit logging with correlation IDs
- **Security Monitoring**: Suspicious activity detection and logging

### 6. **Environment Security**
- **Configuration Validation**: Required environment variables validation
- **Secret Management**: Secure secret key handling with strength validation
- **Production Safeguards**: Prevents insecure default values in production

## üîß Security Configuration

### Required Environment Variables

```bash
# Critical Security Variables (REQUIRED)
SECRET_KEY=your-super-secret-jwt-key-minimum-32-chars
FILE_ENCRYPTION_KEY=your-base64-encoded-fernet-key
DATABASE_ENCRYPTION_KEY=your-base64-encoded-fernet-key

# Optional Security Settings
SESSION_TIMEOUT_MINUTES=30
MAX_CONCURRENT_SESSIONS=3
MAX_INACTIVE_MINUTES=15
ENABLE_RATE_LIMITING=true
```

### Rate Limiting Configuration

| Endpoint | Requests/Minute | Requests/Hour | Burst Limit |
|----------|----------------|---------------|------------|
| `/auth/token` | 10 | 100 | 5 |
| `/auth/register` | 5 | 20 | 3 |
| `/analysis/analyze` | 20 | 200 | 10 |
| `/admin/settings` | 5 | 50 | 3 |
| `/health` | 120 | 2000 | 50 |

## üö® Security Best Practices

### 1. **Password Requirements**
- Minimum 12 characters
- Must contain uppercase, lowercase, digit, and special character
- No common patterns or dictionary words
- No repeated characters or sequences

### 2. **File Upload Security**
- Only allowed file types: PDF, DOCX, DOC, TXT
- Maximum file sizes: PDF (50MB), Office docs (25MB), TXT (10MB)
- Magic number validation for file type verification
- Content scanning for malicious patterns

### 3. **Session Security**
- Automatic session cleanup
- Concurrent session limits
- Session invalidation on password change
- Activity tracking and timeout enforcement

### 4. **API Security**
- CSRF tokens required for state-changing operations
- Rate limiting per endpoint
- Comprehensive input validation
- Security headers on all responses

## üîç Security Monitoring

### Logged Security Events
- Authentication attempts (success/failure)
- Password changes
- Session creation/invalidation
- Rate limit violations
- File upload attempts
- Suspicious input patterns
- CSRF token validation failures

### Security Headers
All API responses include comprehensive security headers:
- `X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff`
- `X-Frame-Options: DENY`
- `X-XSS-Protection: 1; mode=block`
- `Content-Security-Policy: [comprehensive policy]`
- `Strict-Transport-Security: [HTTPS only]`
- `Cross-Origin-*: [restrictive policies]`

## üè• HIPAA Compliance Features

### Administrative Safeguards
- User access controls and authentication
- Session management and timeout
- Audit logging and monitoring
- Security incident response procedures

### Physical Safeguards
- Encrypted data storage
- Secure file handling
- Access control mechanisms

### Technical Safeguards
- Data encryption at rest and in transit
- Access controls and authentication
- Audit controls and logging
- Integrity controls and validation
- Transmission security

## üöÄ Deployment Security Checklist

### Pre-Deployment
- [ ] Generate strong encryption keys (minimum 32 characters)
- [ ] Set all required environment variables
- [ ] Verify no default/insecure values in production
- [ ] Enable HTTPS/TLS encryption
- [ ] Configure proper CORS origins
- [ ] Set up security monitoring and alerting

### Post-Deployment
- [ ] Verify security headers are present
- [ ] Test rate limiting functionality
- [ ] Validate CSRF protection
- [ ] Confirm file upload restrictions
- [ ] Test session management
- [ ] Verify error message sanitization
- [ ] Check audit logging functionality

## üîß Security Maintenance

### Regular Tasks
- Monitor security logs for suspicious activity
- Review and rotate encryption keys (quarterly)
- Update dependencies for security patches
- Review and update rate limiting rules
- Audit user sessions and access patterns
- Test security controls and procedures

### Incident Response
- Document all security incidents
- Implement immediate containment measures
- Notify affected users and authorities as required
- Conduct post-incident analysis and improvements
- Update security procedures based on lessons learned

## üìû Security Support

For security-related questions or to report vulnerabilities:
- Review security logs in the application
- Check environment configuration
- Verify all security middleware is active
- Test security controls regularly

## üîÑ Security Updates

This security implementation follows industry best practices and is regularly updated to address new threats and vulnerabilities. All security features are designed to be:

- **Defense in Depth**: Multiple layers of security controls
- **Fail Secure**: Security controls fail in a secure state
- **Principle of Least Privilege**: Minimal necessary access
- **Continuous Monitoring**: Ongoing security assessment
- **Incident Response Ready**: Prepared for security incidents

---

**Note**: This security implementation provides a strong foundation for HIPAA compliance, but organizations should conduct their own security assessments and implement additional controls as needed for their specific environment and requirements.
