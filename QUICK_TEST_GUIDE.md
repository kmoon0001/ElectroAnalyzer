# Quick Test Guide - Analysis Fixes

## 🚀 How to Start

**Option 1: Simple Start (Recommended)**
```bash
START_SIMPLE.bat
```

**Option 2: Full Start with Health Checks**
```bash
START_THERAPY_ANALYZER.bat
```

**Option 3: Double-Click Start**
```bash
DOUBLE_CLICK_TO_START.bat
```

## ✅ What Was Fixed

### 1. Progress Stuck at 5% ❌ → ✅
**Before:** Analysis would get stuck at 5% and never progress
**After:** Progress smoothly goes from 0% → 100%

### 2. UI Styling 🎨
**Before:** Flat, basic appearance
**After:** Modern Qt/PySide look with depth, gradients, and polish

## 🧪 Testing the Fixes

### Test 1: Progress Flow (CRITICAL)
1. **Start the app** using one of the scripts above
2. **Upload a document** (PDF, DOCX, or TXT)
3. **Select discipline** (PT, OT, or SLP)
4. **Click "Start Analysis"**
5. **Watch the progress bar carefully:**
   - ✅ Should start at 0%
   - ✅ Should update smoothly (5%, 10%, 30%, 50%, 60%, 85%, 95%, 100%)
   - ✅ Should NOT get stuck at 5%
   - ✅ Status messages should update

**Expected Progress Flow:**
```
0%   → "Starting analysis pipeline..."
5%   → "Parsing document content..."
10%  → "Preprocessing document text..."
30%  → "Performing PHI redaction..."
50%  → "Classifying document type..."
60%  → "Running compliance analysis..."
85%  → "Enriching analysis results..."
95%  → "Generating report..."
100% → "Analysis complete."
```

### Test 2: UI Appearance (Visual Check)

**Buttons:**
- [ ] Primary button has blue gradient with glossy effect
- [ ] Hover makes button slightly elevated
- [ ] Click shows pressed state
- [ ] Disabled buttons are grayed out

**Progress Bar:**
- [ ] Has inset shadow (looks recessed)
- [ ] Blue gradient fill with glow
- [ ] Glossy highlight on top
- [ ] Smooth animation

**Cards:**
- [ ] Show depth with shadows
- [ ] Gradient backgrounds
- [ ] Proper borders

**Dropzone:**
- [ ] Gradient background
- [ ] Dashed border
- [ ] Hover effect changes appearance
- [ ] Active state when dragging

**Scrollbars:**
- [ ] Qt-style appearance
- [ ] Gradient on thumb
- [ ] Hover changes color

### Test 3: Functionality

**Document Upload:**
- [ ] Drag and drop works
- [ ] Browse button works
- [ ] File name displays
- [ ] File size shows

**Analysis Controls:**
- [ ] Discipline dropdown works
- [ ] Strictness cards are clickable
- [ ] Active strictness is highlighted
- [ ] Start button enables/disables correctly

**Results:**
- [ ] Findings appear after completion
- [ ] Compliance score displays
- [ ] Report HTML can be opened
- [ ] No errors in console

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Progress Still Stuck at 5%?
1. **Check browser console** (F12) for errors
2. **Verify backend is running** - check API window
3. **Check network tab** - ensure status polling is working
4. **Try a different document** - some files may cause issues

### UI Doesn't Look Right?
1. **Hard refresh** - Ctrl+Shift+R or Cmd+Shift+R
2. **Clear cache** - Browser may be caching old CSS
3. **Check if build is updated** - Run `npm run build` in frontend folder

### Backend Errors?
1. **Check Python version** - Need 3.11+
2. **Verify dependencies** - Run `pip install -r requirements.txt`
3. **Check logs** - Look at API server window for errors

### Frontend Won't Start?
1. **Check Node version** - Need 18+
2. **Install dependencies** - Run `npm install` in frontend/electron-react-app
3. **Try clean build** - Delete build folder and rebuild

## 📊 Success Criteria

### ✅ All Tests Pass If:
- Progress goes from 0% to 100% without getting stuck
- UI has modern Qt-like appearance with depth
- All buttons and controls work smoothly
- Analysis completes successfully
- Results display correctly

### ❌ Issues to Report:
- Progress gets stuck at any percentage
- UI looks flat or broken
- Buttons don't respond
- Analysis fails or times out
- Console shows errors

## 📝 Files Changed

The following files were modified to fix the issues:

**Frontend Logic:**
- `frontend/electron-react-app/src/features/analysis/hooks/useAnalysisController.ts`
- `frontend/electron-react-app/electron/workers/analysisWorker.js`

**Styling:**
- `frontend/electron-react-app/src/features/analysis/pages/AnalysisPage.module.css`
- `frontend/electron-react-app/src/components/ui/Button.module.css`
- `frontend/electron-react-app/src/components/ui/Card.module.css`
- `frontend/electron-react-app/src/theme/global.css`

## 🎯 Next Steps

After testing:
1. ✅ Verify all fixes work as expected
2. 📸 Take screenshots of the new UI
3. 📝 Document any remaining issues
4. 🚀 Deploy to production if all tests pass

## 💡 Tips

- **Use a real document** for testing (not just test files)
- **Watch the entire progress flow** from start to finish
- **Test multiple times** to ensure consistency
- **Try different disciplines** (PT, OT, SLP)
- **Test different strictness levels**
- **Check both light and dark themes** if available
