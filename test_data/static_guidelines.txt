Medical/Treatment Diagnoses
ICD-10 diagnosis codes that match the condition being treated. (SHOULD WE NOTE THAT MEDICAL AND TX DX NEED TO BE  DIFFERENT?
‚òê
Reason for Referral / Current Illness
Explains functional loss or medical issue prompting therapy. Include source of referral (e.g., nursing documentation, EMR, RNA, QMs). Document specific recent changes in condition such as falls, contractures, hospitalizations, or failed screenings. Supports medical necessity and helps establish a therapy baseline.
‚òê
Prior Level of Function (PLOF)
Clearly defines the patient's prior independence or ability in mobility, ADLs, cognition, communication, and swallowing. Be specific (e.g., walked 200 ft with cane independently, dressed with supervision, WAS SAFELY SWALLOWING REGULAR TEXTURES/THIN LIQUIDS, INDEPENDENT FOR COGNITIVE COMMUNICTION FUNCTIONS). Essential for goal setting and demonstrating progress or decline.
‚òê
Clinical Impression / Skilled Services Justified
Explains the complexity of the patient's medical condition and justifies the need for skilled therapy. Why ARE the skills of a licensed therapist medically necessary to perform treatment effectively and safely?
‚òê
STG / LTG
Goals are functional, measurable, and time-bound. Upgrade or downgrade goals every 2 weeks. If continuing same goals, justify in the comment section why they remain necessary (SHOULD WE DELETE THIS FROM EVAL PORTION BECAUSE IT IS PERTAINING TO PROGRESS/RECERT? IT IS ALREAY THERE AS WELL üôÇ))
