# Report Elements and Compliance Features

This document details the components of the HTML compliance report generated by the Therapy Compliance Analyzer. Each element is designed to provide clear, actionable insights into documentation compliance.

## 1. Header
- **Element**: `<h1>Clinical Compliance Report</h1>`
- **Purpose**: Provides a clear and professional title for the document.

## 2. Analysis Summary
This section offers a high-level overview of the analysis results.

- **Element**: `<strong>Document:</strong>`
  - **Purpose**: Displays the name of the analyzed document for easy identification.
- **Element**: `<strong>Analysis Date:</strong>`
  - **Purpose**: Records the date the analysis was performed, providing a timestamp for the report.
- **Element**: `<strong>Overall Compliance Score:</strong>`
  - **Purpose**: Shows a single, quantitative score representing the document's overall compliance level.
  - **Compliance Feature**: This score is calculated using a **weighted algorithm** that considers the severity and potential financial impact of each finding, offering a more nuanced assessment than a simple count of errors.
- **Element**: `<strong>Total Findings:</strong>`
  - **Purpose**: States the total number of compliance issues identified in the document.

## 3. Findings Table
This is the core of the report, providing a detailed breakdown of each compliance issue.

- **Element**: `<th>Risk/Severity</th>`
  - **Purpose**: Displays the assessed risk level of each finding (e.g., High, Medium, Low).
  - **Compliance Feature**: This helps users prioritize the most critical issues that require immediate attention.
- **Element**: `<th>Problematic Text</th>`
  - **Purpose**: Quotes the exact text from the document that was flagged as non-compliant.
  - **Compliance Feature**: This provides direct, verifiable evidence for each finding, ensuring transparency and making it easy for therapists to locate the issue in the original document.
- **Element**: `<th>Personalized Tip</th>`
  - **Purpose**: Provides a custom-generated, actionable tip for correcting the identified issue.
  - **Compliance Feature**: The system's **Natural Language Generation (NLG)** capabilities produce advice that is tailored to the specific context of the finding, making it more effective than generic suggestions.
- **Element**: `<th>Habit for Improvement</th>`
  - **Purpose**: Suggests a broader "habit" or best practice that can help prevent similar issues in the future.
  - **Compliance Feature**: This promotes long-term improvement by focusing on the root causes of compliance errors, rather than just fixing individual mistakes.
- **Element**: `<th>Actions</th>`
  - **Purpose**: This column is reserved for interactive elements in the user interface.
  - **Compliance Feature**: Future enhancements will include buttons to **dispute findings**. A disputed finding will be visually marked (e.g., with a red background) and can be used as feedback to improve the AI model over time.
- **Row Styling**: `class="low-confidence"`
  - **Purpose**: A special style applied to rows where the AI's confidence in the finding is below a certain threshold.
  - **Compliance Feature**: This is a key aspect of **Ethical & Transparent AI**. By clearly flagging uncertain findings, the system empowers the user to apply their own judgment and reduces the risk of over-reliance on the AI.

## 4. AI Model Limitations
- **Element**: `<div class="limitations">`
- **Purpose**: Contains a standardized disclaimer that outlines the capabilities and limitations of the AI models used in the analysis.
- **Compliance Feature**: This section promotes **transparency and responsible AI use**. It ensures that users are aware that the tool is an assistant, not a replacement for professional judgment.

## 5. Footer
- **Element**: `<div class="footer">`
- **Purpose**: Contains metadata about the report generation.
- **Content**: Includes the report generation timestamp and a final disclaimer advising that the report is for informational purposes only.
