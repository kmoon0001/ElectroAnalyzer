### For Advanced Users
- Enable "prominent" visibility for maximum coaching benefit
- Turn on AI-powered mapping for more contextual habit selection
- Expand personal development section by default
- Enable all educational features for comprehensive learning

### For Organizations
- Standardize visibility level across teams for consistency
- Enable progression tracking for quality improvement metrics
- Consider anonymous analytics for benchmarking
- Provide training on the 7 Habits framework for maximum benefit
