# 🎯 Ready to Test - Analysis Fixes

## What Was Fixed

### 1. ✅ Analysis Stuck at 5% Progress
The analysis would get stuck at 5% and never progress. This is now **FIXED**.

### 2. ✅ UI Styling (Qt/PySide Look)
The UI lacked the polished "feng shui" of Qt applications. Now has **modern Qt-like appearance**.

---

## 🚀 Quick Start (3 Steps)

### Step 1: Start the Application
```bash
START_SIMPLE.bat
```
*This will start both the backend API and frontend Electron app*

### Step 2: Test the Progress Fix
1. Upload a document (any PDF, DOCX, or TXT)
2. Select discipline (PT, OT, or SLP)
3. Click **"Start Analysis"**
4. **Watch the progress bar carefully:**
   - Should start at **0%**
   - Should progress smoothly: 5% → 10% → 30% → 50% → 60% → 85% → 95% → 100%
   - Should **NOT get stuck at 5%** ✅

### Step 3: Check the UI Improvements
Look for these Qt-like improvements:
- **Buttons** have 3D gradient appearance with glossy effect
- **Progress bar** has inset shadow and glossy blue fill
- **Cards** show depth with shadows
- **Dropzone** has gradient background
- **Scrollbars** match Qt style

## 🐛 If Something Goes Wrong

### Progress Still Stuck?
1. Check browser console (F12) for errors
2. Verify backend is running (check API window)
3. Try a different document

### UI Doesn't Look Right?
1. Hard refresh: **Ctrl+Shift+R**
2. Clear browser cache
3. Rebuild frontend: `npm run build`

### Backend Won't Start?
1. Check Python version: `python --version` (need 3.11+)
2. Install dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
3. Check for port conflicts (port 8001)

## 📊 What Changed

### Code Changes (6 files)
1. `useAnalysisController.ts` - Fixed progress clamping
2. `analysisWorker.js` - Fixed worker progress tracking
3. `AnalysisPage.module.css` - Qt-style page components
4. `Button.module.css` - 3D gradient buttons
5. `Card.module.css` - Cards with depth
6. `global.css` - Qt-style scrollbars

### No Backend Changes
The backend was already working correctly. All fixes were in the frontend.

## 🎉 That's It!

You're ready to test. Just run:
```bash
START_SIMPLE.bat
```

And follow the 3 steps above. The analysis should now progress smoothly from 0% to 100% without getting stuck, and the UI should look much more polished with a modern Qt appearance.
